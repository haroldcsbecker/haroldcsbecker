### 👋 Hey, I'm Harold C S Becker — software developer from Brazil 🇧🇷

I love solving real problems through code and building things that make life easier — for me, my team, or anyone who stumbles upon my work. Most of my time is spent writing code, exploring new technologies, and contributing to software that matters.

I specialize in **backend development**, with hands-on experience in **PHP**, **Node.js**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**. Over the years, I've worked with microservices, scalable APIs, complex integrations, and cloud-native architectures using tools like **Docker**, **AWS (Lambda, EC2, SQS, etc.)**, and **RabbitMQ**.

I'm used to working in agile environments, contributing to system architecture decisions, performing code reviews, and maintaining high-quality codebases through **TDD**, **Clean Code**, and **SOLID principles**.

I hold a degree in Information Systems and continue to sharpen my skills through hands-on experience, experimentation, and constant learning.

### ✨ **About me**
🚀 Passionate about clean software architecture and design patterns  
🧪 Enjoy experimenting with tech stacks and building automations  
🐧 Work comfortably with Linux environments and containerized solutions  
🛠️ Build tools and utilities to speed up workflows  
🌱 Always learning — especially interested in distributed systems and clean architecture  
💡 The “let’s automate this” kind of teammate
📚 Love sharing knowledge and collaborating on technical solutions
